Hello Charbel ! These are a few pages of how my application might look like.
I'll surely need the UI/UX instructor's help as the design doesn't seem that modern.
The conflict is that I want it to be modern but at the same time the application is not 
related to business or ecommerce or fintech.. It is a book THRIFT shop and I want it to have 
a cozy feeling. 

(It still doesn't look like how I pictured it in my mind but that's the most I could do on figma.com)
